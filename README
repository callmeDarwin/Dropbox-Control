History: 
I ran into a problem where I couldn't ssh into my server because of a router problem and needed to restart a service.  I knew that dropbox on the server was still working so I decided that it would be nice to be able to control the server by just putting files into Dropbox.

Installing:

I found 'incron' a program that will monitor directories for file changes and involks an command.

My incrontab looks something like this:

<Dropbox Path>/linux_control IN_MODIFY,IN_CLOSE_WRITE,IN_MOVE <PATH>/dbc $@ $#


Then all you do is put a file with the name being the command with '.' for spaces in the <Dropbox Path>/linux_control/ folder (ie apache2.restart restarts the apache2 server).

You need to also setup you sudoers to bypass the password prompting.

I am hoping to be able to have output from the command put into a log file but that doesn't seem to be working just yet.

The dbc script simply takes the second parameter as the file name and parses it and executed it.  The first parameter contains the <Dropbox Path> for the logging.

Example:

dbc <Dropbox Path> apache2.restart

I know this a very simple project and script but I would like to expand it to allow for other features.

Suggestions are greatly encouraged.
